% [runs, n_runs] = runs_definition(study_nm, sub_nm, condition)
%runs_definition will define the number and order of the physical and

%
% INPUTS
% study_nm: study name
%
% sub_nm: subject name
%
% condition: in some rare cases we have behavior, but not fMRI data. This
% variable allows to take into account this so that the corresponding runs
% are still included in the behavioral analysis but not in the fMRI
% analysis.
% 'behavior': behavioral analysis
% 'behavior_no_sat': behavioral analysis without the runs where subject
% saturated
% 'fMRI': fMRI analysis
% 'fMRI_no_move': fMRI analysis without runs where too much movement
%
% OUTPUTS
% runs: structure with number of runs for each task and also the order of
% the runs
%
% n_runs: number of runs to include
